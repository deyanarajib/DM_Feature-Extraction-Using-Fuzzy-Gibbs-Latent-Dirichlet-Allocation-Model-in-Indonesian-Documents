# Feature Extraction Using Fuzzy-Gibbs Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model in Indonesian Documents
Was a collaborative project with Miftahul Huda that has been used in his Study of Literature course: "Feature Extraction Menggunakan Fuzzy-Gibbs Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model pada Dokumen Berbahasa Indonesia", with the aim to extract features from Indonesian documents using Fuzzy-Gibbs LDA. The used methods on this project are base by a journal by Putu Manik P., I Ketut Gede D. P., Ida Ayu D. G., and Made S.: "Fuzzy-Gibbs Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model for Feature Extraction on Indonesian Documents".
